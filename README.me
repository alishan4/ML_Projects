ML Projects Portfolio

Author: Alishan

This repository contains my collection of projects exploring concepts in Machine Learning (ML), Mathematics for ML, and applied Statistical Analysis. Each project demonstrates step-by-step implementations, visualizations, and results to strengthen my foundations and showcase practical skills.

ðŸ”¢ Linear Algebra for ML
1. Vector Operations

Implemented vector addition, subtraction, dot product, and scaling.

Applied on player statistics to understand data transformations.

2. Matrix Operations

Matrix multiplication and transformations for ML.

Used for prediction calculations in simple ML pipelines.

ðŸ“ˆ Statistical Feature Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Housing datasets.

Probability distributions and descriptive statistics.

Identified key features influencing housing prices.

ðŸ¤– Classical Machine Learning Models
1. Naive Bayes Classifier

Built from scratch using probability and Bayes theorem.

Applied to categorical datasets for classification.

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Eigenvalue and eigenvector decomposition.

Dimensionality reduction and visualization.

Combined with Naive Bayes for classification.

3. Decision Tree

Implemented classification on the Iris dataset.

Visualized decision boundaries.

4. Random Forest Classification

Binary classification on the Iris dataset.

Used RandomForestClassifier with evaluation metrics.

Achieved accuracy of ~97%.

Relevance: Demonstrates ensemble learning, often applied in fraud detection and anomaly detection.

ðŸš€ Relevance
