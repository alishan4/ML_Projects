#  Player Performance Predictor

An advanced implementation of matrix operations for machine learning, simulating a player performance prediction system.

## Features
- Synthetic data generation
- Data normalization (ML best practice)
- Matrix multiplication for predictions
- Evaluation metrics calculation
- Results visualization

## Technical Details
- Uses NumPy for matrix operations
- Implements ML preprocessing techniques
- Includes visualization with Matplotlib
- Object-oriented design for reusability

## How It Works
1. Generates synthetic player data (like database records)
2. Normalizes the data for better model performance
3. Applies weights using matrix multiplication to get predictions
4. Evaluates the results using basic metrics
5. Visualizes the predictions and feature importance

## Results
The model outputs performance scores for each player and shows which features (runs, wickets, matches) are most important for performance prediction.
