# Day 1: Vector Operations for ML
## Overview
- Implements vector operations (dot product, addition, norm) using NumPy.
- Simulates player stats dataset (runs, wickets) like PHP/MyAdmin tables.
## Dataset
- Synthetic: 4 players, runs [100, 150, 200, 50], wickets [2, 5, 3, 1].
## Results
- Dot product: [TBD after running]
- Norm: [TBD]
## ML Relevance
- Vectors as features, dot product as feature weighting.
